Abstract
The JobTrails project is a front-end development initiative created by first-year B.Tech CSE students to demonstrate their skills in building a responsive, user-friendly job search platform. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JobTrails focuses on providing job seekers with a seamless, mobile-friendly interface for browsing job listings. It features dynamic filters for location, job type, and other criteria, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

While the platform is currently front-end only, future improvements include backend integration for real-time job updates, user authentication, and personalized alerts. The project serves as a foundation for a more advanced, fully functional job search tool.
