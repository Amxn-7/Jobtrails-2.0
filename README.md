**Abstract**  
The JobTrails project is a front-end development initiative created by first-year B.Tech CSE students to demonstrate their skills in building a responsive, user-friendly job search platform. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JobTrails offers job seekers a seamless, mobile-friendly interface for browsing job listings.
